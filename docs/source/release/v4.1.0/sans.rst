ISIS SANS Interface
-------------------

Improvements
############

- Increased font size in run table.
- For ZOOM, SHIFT user file command now moves monitor 5.
- Batch files no longer require an output name to load. When processing, an auto-generated name is used instead.
- canSAS output mode will be disable if 2D reduction mode is selected to avoid accidental errors with data dimension.
- The path to the user file used to reduce the data is now added to the workspace sample logs. This user file path is added to canSAS file metadata.

Bug Fixes
#########

- Fixed the error seen when saving to file with event slice data. Event slice output files now contain transmission workspaces.
- Exporting table as a batch file is fixed for Mantid Workbench.
- The warning message raised when you have supplied a transmission run without a direct run has been suppressed when data is still being input. The warning will still be raised if you load or process the data.
