:ref:`Release 4.1.0 <v4.1.0>`

Algorithms
----------

Improvements
############

- :ref:`ModeratorTzeroLinear <algm-ModeratorTzeroLinear>` permits now passing parameter values as input properties.
- :ref:`BASISPowderDiffraction <algm-BASISPowderDiffraction>` resolves between run with old and new DAS.
- :ref:`BASISPowderDiffraction <algm-BASISPowderDiffraction>` permits now flux normalization by proton charge and run duration.
- :ref:`BASISReduction <algm-BASISReduction>` permits now flux normalization by proton charge and run duration.
- :ref:`BASISReduction <algm-BASISReduction>` permits now retaining events only within a time window.
- :ref:`BASISReduction <algm-BASISReduction>` can output now the powder diffraction spectra.
- :ref:`BASISCrystalDiffraction <algm-BASISCrystalDiffraction>` resolves between run with old and new DAS.


Data Analysis Interface
-----------------------

Improvements
############
- Improved the output options of MSD Fit, Iqt Fit, Conv Fit and F(Q)Fit so that Chi_squared can now be plotted.
- Improved the I(Q, t) tab by adding more validation checks for the input data.
- Improved the Fit and Difference plots in MSD Fit, Iqt Fit, Conv Fit and F(Q)Fit. It is now possible to adjust their
  relative sizes by dragging a 'handle' between the plots.

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fixed an error caused by loading a Sample into ConvFit which does not have a resolution parameter for the analyser.
- Fixed a crash caused by changing the Preview Spectrum on Elwin after clicking Run.


Data Corrections Interface
--------------------------

Improvements
############
- Improved the setting of sample and container neutron information by allowing the entry of cross sections as an 
  alternative to a chemical formula. The cross sections can be entered in the Calculate Paalman Pings tab and
  Calculate Monte Carlo Absorption tab. This uses the :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>` algorithm.

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fixed a bug where the output plots on the Calculate Paalman Pings and Calculate Monte Carlo Absorption tabs had
  the wrong axis labels and units.


Data Reduction Interface
------------------------

Improvements
############
- Added an option called *Group Output* to group the output files from a reduction on ISISEnergyTransfer.

Bug Fixes
#########
- Fixed a bug in the :ref:`Integration <algm-Integration>` algorithm causing the Moments tab to crash.
- Fixed an unexpected error when opening the Data Reduction interface with an unrelated facility selected.
